This is a clone of Twitter's page using Bootstrap.

The top of the page is built using the navbar class. The rest of the page is divided into three columns, the left, center and right. The left column consists of a list of header classes. The center column consists of a list of article classes that represents the tweets. The right column consists of lists of images, spans and headers.
